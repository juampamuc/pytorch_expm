# pytorch_expm
An implementation of the scaling-and-squaring algorithm for matrix exponentials and their Fréchet derivatives in Pytorch.
I will soon do a pull request on the official Pytorch repository. At the current stage, this algorithm is optimized for single precision.
This repository contains an algorithm to find the correct scaling coefficients for single-precision accuracy of the Fréchet derivative, which is implemented in MATLAB's symbolic toolbox.
